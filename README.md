Features
========

This module provides tools and a UI for creating modules that bundle prebuilt
config and content for easy reuse.

It also provides a UI that allows users to safely turn these features on and off
without giving them access to Backdrop's main module page.

This module is not a port of the Drupal 7 Features module, but it is an attempt
to implement the original vision of the Features module using Backdrop's
configuration management as its base.
